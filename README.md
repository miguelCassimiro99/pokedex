# Pokedex
This little project uses the PokéAPI to show some informations about a Pokemon informed
<h5>See the result in this <a href="https://miguelcassimiro99.github.io/pokedex/">link</a></h5>

This repository was made to lear more and practice about the Axios using where it handle requests on PokéAPI
On the index.html you'll find a simple form that you put a Pokémon's name and submit the search with the button 'Search' and then, axios makes possible to show some informations like:
- Name
- Type
- Abilities
- Moves


Like a just little project, the main reason that it was done it's to apply and test knowledge about Axios, forEach, arrows functions, and ways to deal with what is going to be showed for the user.
So some kinds of aspects like style were worked a little.
